Extract From Website
====================

This script extracts the promotions from shutterfly. It then will email you
the list of promotions.

Debug
-----

Execute the debug script, and the script will only email the message to the
first email address in the "emails" file (usually this would be your email), and
will not delete any of the files that are generated by the script, so that you
can analyze the files and figure out what is happening.

Emails File
-----------

Just list each email address that will receive the email on a separate line.

This file also allows comments

sample:

```
# Comment
user1@domain.com
user2@domain.com
user3@domain.com
```

Cronjob
-------

create a new cronjob by executing this:

```bash
crontab -e
```

and enter the below.

Run the script daily at 9:00am.

```bash
0 9 * * 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 /PATH/TO/extract-from-shutterfly
```

Note: 0 is the minute of the day, 9 is the hour of the day, * means
any day of the month, * means any month. Therefore the script runs everyday at
9:00am.
